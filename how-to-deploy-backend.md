# Mac Backend Server Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to set up your Mac as a backend server accessible from anywhere, while maintaining security and reliability.

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, you need:

1. Admin access to your Mac
2. Access to your router's admin panel
3. A domain name (can use a free dynamic DNS service)
4. Homebrew installed (will be installed by script if missing)

## Security Notice

This setup exposes your Mac to the internet. The script implements several security measures, but you should:

- Keep your Mac's firewall enabled
- Regularly update your system
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Use strong passwords
- Consider additional security measures for production use

## Quick Start

1. Run the setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup-mac-server.sh
./setup-mac-server.sh
```

2. Follow the interactive prompts to configure:
   - Domain name
   - SSL certificate
   - Ports
   - Environment variables

## Manual Setup Steps

If you prefer manual setup or need to troubleshoot:

### 1. Install Required Software

```bash
# Install Homebrew if not present
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install nginx
brew install nginx

# Install certbot for SSL
brew install certbot
```

### 2. Configure Dynamic DNS

1. Sign up for a free dynamic DNS service (e.g., No-IP, DuckDNS)
2. Create a hostname (e.g., myapp.duckdns.org)
3. Install the dynamic DNS client:
```bash
# For DuckDNS
brew install ddclient
```

### 3. Configure Nginx

1. Create nginx configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/youtube-notes.conf
```

2. Use this template:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.duckdns.org;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.duckdns.org;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

### 4. Set Up SSL

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.duckdns.org
```

### 5. Configure Port Forwarding

1. Access your router's admin panel
2. Forward ports 80 and 443 to your Mac's local IP
3. Set up your Mac with a static local IP

### 6. Start Services

```bash
# Start nginx
sudo brew services start nginx

# Start the backend (using PM2 for reliability)
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start "python main.py" --name "youtube-notes-backend"
pm2 save
```

### 7. Update Frontend Configuration

Update the API URL in your frontend config:

```javascript
// In frontend/src/config.js
export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-domain.duckdns.org';
```

## Maintenance

### Monitoring

Check server status:
```bash
pm2 status
pm2 logs youtube-notes-backend
```

Check nginx logs:
```bash
tail -f /usr/local/var/log/nginx/access.log
tail -f /usr/local/var/log/nginx/error.log
```

### SSL Certificate Renewal

Certbot will automatically renew certificates. Verify with:
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

### Backup

Regularly backup your:
- SSL certificates
- nginx configuration
- Environment variables
- Database (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Can't access server remotely:**
   - Check port forwarding
   - Verify nginx is running
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify DNS propagation

2. **SSL certificate issues:**
   - Verify certificate paths in nginx config
   - Check certificate expiration
   - Run certbot renewal

3. **Application errors:**
   - Check PM2 logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check disk space

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Restart nginx
sudo brew services restart nginx

# Check open ports
sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN

# Check nginx process
ps aux | grep nginx

# View PM2 logs
pm2 logs

# Monitor system resources
top
```

## Security Recommendations

1. **Firewall Configuration:**
   - Enable Mac firewall
   - Only allow necessary ports
   - Consider using Little Snitch for enhanced control

2. **Access Control:**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Consider implementing rate limiting
   - Set up fail2ban for brute force protection

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regularly check logs
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
   - Monitor system resources

4. **Updates:**
   - Keep macOS updated
   - Regularly update nginx
   - Keep application dependencies updated

## Frontend Deployment

The frontend should be deployed to Google Cloud (as mentioned). Follow these steps:

1. Build the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

2. Deploy to Google Cloud:
```bash
gcloud app deploy
```

# Remember to update the API_BASE_URL in the frontend configuration to point to your Mac server's domain.

Now, let me explain the architecture and tools we're using:

System Architecture and Tools

Caching and compression
Rate limiting
Better handling of static files
Security headers management
2. PM2 (Process Manager)
Purpose: Manages the Python FastAPI backend process

### Narrative and basic --> intermediate --> advanced
Let me explain the different approaches to setting up your Mac as a backend server, from simplest to recommended:

## Barebones Option: Direct FastAPI Exposure

The most basic setup would be:
1. Configure your router to forward port 8000 to your Mac
2. Run the FastAPI server directly: `python main.py`
3. Update frontend to use your public IP address

This would work, but has serious drawbacks:
- No HTTPS, making all data transfer insecure
- Your public IP changes regularly, breaking the frontend connection
- No process management (server dies if there's an error)
- Direct exposure of your application to the internet
- No protection against DDoS or brute force attacks
- Manual restart required if your Mac or the app crashes

## Recommended Solution: Secure Proxy Setup

Our recommended setup uses multiple layers to provide security and reliability:

1. **Nginx as Reverse Proxy**
   - Handles SSL/HTTPS encryption
   - Provides security headers and rate limiting
   - Manages connections efficiently
   - Serves as a buffer between internet and your app

2. **Dynamic DNS Service**
   - Gives you a permanent domain name (like `yourapp.duckdns.org`)
   - Automatically updates when your IP changes
   - Frontend always knows where to find your backend

3. **Process Management with PM2**
   - Keeps your application running
   - Auto-restarts if it crashes
   - Provides monitoring and logs
   - Handles startup after Mac reboots

Here's the flow:
```
Internet -> Router -> Nginx (443) -> FastAPI (8000)
```

The setup script we created automates this entire process:
1. Installs required software (nginx, certbot, PM2)
2. Configures SSL certificates
3. Sets up secure nginx configuration
4. Configures process management
5. Provides monitoring tools

You just need to:
1. Run the script: `sudo ./setup-mac-server.sh`
2. Follow the prompts
3. Configure router port forwarding
4. Update frontend configuration

This gives you:
- Secure HTTPS connections
- Reliable domain name
- Automatic process recovery
- Protection against common attacks
- Easy monitoring and maintenance

## Middle Ground Alternative

If the full setup seems too complex but you need more than the barebones option, you could:
1. Use nginx without SSL initially
2. Skip process management
3. Use a service like ngrok for temporary deployments

This would be easier to set up but less suitable for long-term use.

The key is understanding that while the recommended solution seems more complex, it automates most of the work and protects against common issues that would require manual intervention with simpler setups. The script turns what could be hours of manual configuration into a 10-minute automated process.

Would you like me to provide more details about any of these approaches or explain specific security considerations for your use case?
